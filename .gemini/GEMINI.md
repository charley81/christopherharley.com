## Gemini Added Memories
- The user wants me to explain, guide, and provide information, but NOT to write or change any code unless explicitly asked. The user wants to implement changes themselves for learning purposes.
- The user wants the hero title text to fade out one letter at a time as the user scrolls down and return one at a time when the user scrolls back up.
- The user is using `pnpm` for package management.
- **Progress (Feb 24, 2026):**
    - Successfully implemented **Astro Actions** for the contact form.
    - Set up **Zod validation** with custom error messages.
    - Implemented **Progressive Enhancement** using a client-side `<script>` to handle submissions without a page refresh.
    - Fixed a "flicker" bug caused by missing `setTimeout` delays.
    - Resolved a TypeScript error regarding `HTMLFormElement` vs `HTMLElement`.
    - Next Step: Finalizing **Field-level error messages** (showing "Name is too short" directly under the input) by updating sub-components and the main script loop.
