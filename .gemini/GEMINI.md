## Gemini Added Memories
- The user wants me to explain, guide, and provide information, but NOT to write or change any code unless explicitly asked. The user wants to implement changes themselves for learning purposes.
- The user wants the hero title text to fade out one letter at a time as the user scrolls down and return one at a time when the user scrolls back up.
- The user is using `pnpm` for package management.
