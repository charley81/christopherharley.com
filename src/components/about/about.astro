      <p>I'm an Army veteran and UX Engineer who specializes in designing clean, minimalist interfaces in Figma and implementing them with modern tools like Astro, Next.js, and headless CMSs. My dual background allows me to guide projects from concept to completion, ensuring every detail is considered. I'm seeking a role at an innovative agency where I can apply these end-to-end skills. Outside of work, I'm dedicated to family and friends, and you can also find me playing drums, producing, or DJing underground electronic music.</p>
